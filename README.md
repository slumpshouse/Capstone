# Purpose/Problem Statement
My program creates an interactive shopping simulation that addresses the problem of low user interaction by letting users shop for the trhings they want, while also receiving rewards based on their choices, encouraging engagement through decision-making and rewards.

# Target Audience 
This program is for loyal customers

# Solution + Limitations 
 The program  addresses low customer interaction by creating an engaging shopping experience through item selection, point-based rewards, and payment choices, but it could be improved with features like personalization, loyalty tracking, and feedback systems to further enhance user engagement.
# Key Features / Key Components 
Some key componenets of this progrsm is the point System, the Checkout and Card security. The point-based rewards system allows customers to earn points with each purchase, which can be redeemed for free items or used toward future transactions. The checkout process mirrors standard retail systems. Customers begin by selecting items from the inventory. The system then asks if they want another item and choose a payment method. Upon completing the transaction, it displays the number of points earned and notifies the customer if theyâ€™ve qualified for any free rewards. To enhance realism and customer trust, a card security feature is integrated into the system. When a card is used for payment, the interface masks the first twelve digits and displays only the last four, simulating real-world credit card protection and security.


# Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
It was hard to add two items to one transaction, as well as modifying my conditionals after i made changes to it. I wish i could add more items and give the usee the ability to pick more than one item, as well as give the user the opportunity to use thier points or get the free item they earned.
# Project Timeline 
I began the project by brainstorming different ideas until I decided on one that interested me. Once I had a clear concept, I planned how to structure the program and considered how to incorporate elements involving private user information in a secure way. I started by creating the user input features and then continued to build the rest of the program from there.
